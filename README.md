This repository contains analysis scripts related to Courvan & Parker 2024 (doi to follow).

To repeat most of the analyses in the paper, one can download the processed files from GEO (accession to follow),
set the paths accordingly and run the files.

Specifically, "differentialExpression" and "differentialDegradation" require the GEO files.
Many of the other scripts can be run using the data from Supplementary Table 1.

For certain scripts, files in the "ReferenceMaterial" folder may be helpful.

The GTF referenced throughout is GCF_000001405.40
